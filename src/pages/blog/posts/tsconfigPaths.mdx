# What are TSconfig paths?

TypeScript is a powerful tool that allows developers to write robust and maintainable JavaScript code.
One of the key features of TypeScript is its ability to use the `tsconfig.json` file to configure the compiler options.
One of the most important options in this file is the paths option, which allows you to configure module resolution in your project.

The paths option is an object that maps a package or module name to a location on disk.
For example, you can use the paths option to map the `@src` package to the `src` directory of your project.
This allows you to use the `@src` package name in your imports, instead of having to use relative paths.

# How can I start using them?

To start using them, you need to specify the following options:

<Code
  code={`{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@src/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
`}
/>

In this example, the `baseUrl` is set to the root of the project, and the `paths` option maps the `@src` package to the `src` directory. This allows you to use the following import statement:

<Code code={`import { someModule } from '@src/someModule';`} />

Instead of the following:

<Code code={`import { someModule } from '../src/someModule';`} />

This may not seem like much, but it will make the difference in big projects where file structure can get a bit crazy.
Imports like this make my life hell and my code ugly.

<Code code={`import { someModule } from '../../../../folder/someModule'`} />

Why would you want to do all that just to (for example) import a utility function that removes the protocol from a link
in your React component?

# Worth remembering

You will most likely want to use the `paths` option with the help of wildcards, so you can map multiple directories at once.
This allows you to use the `@src` package name in all imports, regardless of the subdirectory in which the module is located.

For example, if you don't include the wildcard `*`, you cannot access any subdirectories in your paths.

# Conclusion: Why the paths option is a must-have for large TypeScript projects

Using the paths option in your tsconfig.json file is a great way to make your code more maintainable and readable, and it's a must-have for large projects. It can save you a lot of time and effort, and it's definitely worth considering for any TypeScript project.

Please note that for the above configuration to work, you should use the paths in conjunction with a module loader like webpack, otherwise, it won't work.

That's it for today! I hope this article helped you understand how to use the paths option in your tsconfig.json file. Happy coding!
