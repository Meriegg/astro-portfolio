# Hello There

Today I encountered some problems trying to configure my blog to use [Astro's new content directory](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
and I thought someone else might be facing the same problem in the future, so here I am.

# What happened?

After I created an NPM Package for managing my social and contact links throughout my project, I decided to
configure this website to use it as well, since this is the most important source of my contact details.

After I was done I tried to test the website and ran `yarn dev`, everything worked fine in development so I tried building the site
using the `yarn build` and all of a sudden Astro decided to give me this error:

<Code
  code={`error The argument 'path' must be a string or Uint8Array without null bytes. Received '\x00@astro-page:src/pages/blog/posts/tsconfigPaths@_@mdx'`}
/>

Keep in mind that while I was developing new features and bug fixes for this website, I did not face this problem, but
somehow now was the time for this bug to show up.

Okay, I banged my head on the keyboard for 15 minutes searching for a fix - I found nothing.

I decided that it's time to move to the new content directory and use the new functions Astro provides
since `Astro.glob` might be outdated and might be the reason for this error.

I did that and it was pretty easy, all I did was create a `content` directory inside my source folder, create a `config.ts` file
inside the `content` directory and define a collection inside it using zod.

Here is the `config.ts` file:

<Code
code={`import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';\n
const blog = defineCollection({
  type: "content",
  schema: z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    author: z.string(),
    pubDate: z.string(),
    updatedOn: z.string().optional().nullable(),
    description: z.string(),
    authorSocialLink: z.string().optional(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()),
  })
});

export const collections = {
  'blogPosts': blog,
};
`}
codeLabel="config.ts"
/>

One thing to remember is that if you get any error importing `astro:content` always run `yarn astro sync`.

After that I created the `blogPosts` directory and moved my `.mdx` files inside it. All good right?
Well, it fixed the first error, but now it started telling me `.mdx` files were unsupported, and all
blog routes with a `.mdx` extension (basically all of them) were giving 404 errors and not showing up in
the blog page.

# The fix

For one hour I tried everything, from reinstalling the mdx plugin using `yarn astro add mdx`, to
updating Astro again, to searching for related issues on Github but nothing worked.

I spun up a new barebones Astro project quickly so I can test if I will get the same error on a new
project.

I added the mdx plugin, I configured the content directory and created all the routes using `getStaticPaths` and
it worked.

That's when I tried running `yarn add @astrojs/mdx`, updating the mdx plugin directly, not using `yarn astro add mdx`
and it worked, everything went fine.
