# Who am I?

Well, first off, Hello there! I am Mario, a 15 year old full stack developer and designer. I'm familiar with
modern technologies like Next.Js, Typescript, React Native, Prisma, tRPC, GraphQL and the list goes on and on...

## Why is this important?

This is important because these are the topics I am going to post about in the future. I want to use this blog
to teach and help people who are just starting out and are experiencing problems and confusion like I did once I started out with web development.

Things like:

    - What even is backend?
    - Where do I even put my backend code?
    - How do I properly structure my React application?
    - How much JavaScript do I need to know before starting out with React?
    - How much JavaScript do I need to know before starting out with Node?
    - Do I **_really_** need to use TypeScript?
    - Where do I even deploy my application?
    - Can I deploy my backend code along with my front-end code?

Were really confusing me while I was a begginer and just starting out.

I know these sound stupid, and they may be, but I know I had a lot of questions like these as a beginner
and I wasn't able to find clear answers and solutions in one place and I was just forced to shoot in the dark and just learn and practice
those technologies until things became more clear.

# What are my plans?

I plan on making a full platform where I can teach you everything I know about web development.
I don't want people to get stuck on trivial things like I did and potentially quit programming.
